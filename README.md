# generator-helm

Generates a starting point for a Knockout-based web-application. Can be used to generate pages and custom components on the site. Based on the Steven Sanderson's generator-ko, with improvements by techmuch whose repository generator-huddle has been forked to this one. Strictly speaking, this repository is just a customization for changing paths and templates.
